exploit-2a.py
trigger bug on http.c:65 with the function process_client(int fd),
the return address of function process_client can be overwritten by buffer overflow of variable repath[2048]

exploit-2b.py
overwrite function pointer *handler by pypass a huge value to http.c:276:pn[1024]
$./clean-env.sh ./zookld zook-exstack.conf&
$gdb -p $(pgrep zookfs-exstack)
$break point
$./exploit-2b.py localhost 8080
we can find that the function pointer has been altered.

Part 2:
exploit-3.py
The buffer overflow can be used in this part,
we firt push the executable code of Unlink into stack 
and modify the return address of function process_client() 
to point to the executable code in the stack.

Part 3: 
exploit-4a.py
The return address of process_client can be overwritten and altered to 
point to the system function unlink.
exploit-4b.py
The value of function pointer of *handler can be overwritten.
